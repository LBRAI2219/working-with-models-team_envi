# Hands on with models

The repository was created for the group project of the course ["Modélisation des systèmes biologiques"](https://uclouvain.be/en-cours-2017-LBRAI2219.html) from the University of Louvain, in 2017. 

The aim of the course is to get familiar with models in life sciences.


## Objectives of the project:

- getting familiar with models in life sciences in general (why do we need models, what can they do, what are the limitations)
- knowing examples of successfull models in life sciences

- For a specific model:
	- understanding the underlying theory behind the model
	- understanding the limitations of the model
	- being able to run de model
	- being able to perform a set of simulations and interpret those
	- being able to critisize the model

- "Soft-skill" objectives
	- being able to communicate about models in life sciences to an external audience (Twitter)
	- being able to collaborate on a project (GitHub)

	
## Specific tasks:

1. Organise in groups
2. Create a personal account on GitHub
3. create a group in the GitHub Classroom
4. choose a model to study / learn / use

### In GitHub
- use GitHub to store all the material you will use (code, documentation and outputs)
- use the diferent functionalities of github:
	- issues tracking
	- wiki
	- project management

### In Twitter
- create a professional account for the group
- define your communication strategy
	- topics
	- audience
	- frequency
- personalise your profile page
- use the different tools at your disposable
	- images
	- video
	- gifs
	- threads
	- planification
	- replies
	- retweets
	- ...
- for each person, store your contribution in a separate Storify story.
